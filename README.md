Mastering JQuery project for Bov Academy.

This Project utilizes vanilla JS with some JQuery for ajax calls and DOM manipulation. The functionality is controlled by two modules (UserList, UserDetail). I make use of custom events so that the two modules can pass data and "talk" between each other when needed and aides in keeping the modules decoupled.
